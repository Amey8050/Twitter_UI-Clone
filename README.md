# Twitter UI Clone ✨  

Welcome to **Twitter UI Clone**, a minimalist and responsive recreation of Twitter's user interface. This project was built to showcase my **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **npm** skills. The project is styled entirely with **Tailwind CSS**, demonstrating its utility-first approach for crafting clean, modern designs efficiently.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
- **Modern UI Styling**: A clean and elegant layout inspired by Twitter's interface.  
- **Utility-First CSS**: Fully styled using Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and consistent design.  
- **Build and Dev Commands**: Utilizes `npm` scripts to streamline the development process.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** to apply styling directly within the HTML structure. It also relies on **Node.js** and **npm** for managing dependencies and running commands for development and production builds.  

### Key Commands:  

1. **Run Development Server**  
   ```bash  
   npm run dev  
   ```  
   Starts the development server and enables live preview with automatic updates.  

2. **Build for Production**  
   ```bash  
   npm run build  
   ```  
   Generates optimized CSS output for production in the `output.css` file.
